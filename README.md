# Yello (Yolo + DJI Tello)

This repository contains a project that combines DJI Tello and Deep Learning (Tiny Yolo). The aim of this project is to   detect several objects using the drone. It uses Darknet: an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA) and Tellopy : a super friendly api for the drone. 

Although  the weights of the model can be changed, I used the ones pretrained from the official website ([YOLOv3- tiny](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights)). 



Moreover, you can add functionalities easily in the project. Already implemented functionalities:

- Whenever it detects a person it takes a photo
